About the Book and the Demonstration Material
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The goal of the material in this book is to improve Access protection and security,
and, as a result, the material in the book does not target a particular skill level, such
as developer or DBA. More than half of the book is at a level that a competent
Access DBA could manage, and, where possible, I have set up the more complex
demonstration examples as plug-and-play forms. In other words, you can use the
forms in your database with only a few modifications to some constants at the top
of the VBA code. Naturally, because I regularly write for developers’ magazines,
there are some examples that will keep the very skilled end of town happy.

To use any of the downloads, you need to have a copy of the book onhand. If you do not 
have a copy, head to www.apress.com and search for Garry Robinson or goto

Whats In The Zip File
+++++++++++++++++++++

In the download .ZIP file, you will find a separate database for Access 97 called
grMap97.mdb, one for Access 2000 called grMap2000.mdb, and one for Access 2002/
2003 called grMap2002.mdb. Then follow these steps to use the demonstration
databases:
1. Open the database suited to your version of Access.
2. Select the chapter number from the drop-down list at the top of the form
(shown in Figure 1-1).
3. Select the object that you want to review and click the View Object/Code
button at the bottom of the window.

The demonstration database holds approximately 40 different objects. Some
of these modules are re-used for different demonstrations. Some of the modules and
form class modules require references to other common Microsoft libraries. If this
is the case, I have mentioned the library reference in the header of the module.
After you have downloaded the database, you should keep a copy of the demonstration
database in its original form in the .ZIP just in case you need to return
the demonstration database to its original state. Because Access has improved
since 1997, some of the demonstrations apply only to the later versions. 

Apart from the Access demonstration material, you will find a html file with  
download hyperlinks relevant to the material in the chapter. You will find more 
information on this at the end of every chapter.

Finally there is a PDF format document that has all the additional information 
about how to setup a protected folder in Windows XP. This requires that you have 
a copy of the book open on Chapter 12.



Enjoy the downloads and enjoy the book.
